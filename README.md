This repository is created to track the personal Web development journey for Tony Dai.
The repositiory tracks Angela Yu's popular web development course on Udemy called "The Complete 20xx Web Development Bootcamp" as of the 24th of Feb 2024, 17:59.
Some excercises are missing from that course in this repo however that would be most likely because i've moved passed it or it was latent knowledge through my formal training with the software discipline gained through my degree in Mechatronics, this is especially true for the algorithms section.
